Women Techmakers had a great event in 2014, thanks to the support of many individuals and companies.

For our next event we were going back to the drawing board. What are we standing for, what are our values?
While we all in the team intuitively share the same picture of Women Techmakers it was extremely helpful
to put it down and understand our sources of energy, empathy and enthusiasm towards such a community.

## Vision

*Equality & diversity in STEM (science, technology, engineering & mathematics) regardless of gender*

This is the world we are dreaming of. A world where women don't have to give 120% to be taken full.
A world where men and women are working together in exploring science, developing technology,
construct engineering and building a mathematical foundation.
A world where the choice of a specific major in studying is not a question of gender.

We might often talk about *men* and *women*, but we are aware of the wider range which exists,
the specific views of cis- and transgender people, the aspects of non-binary and of agender persons.
A career or education choice in STEM has to be independent of gender identity.

## Values

*Respect, Trust, Fairness, Embrace Differences, Sharing & Supporting, Improvement*

Our values is what we think everyone should be based on. They are also what we use to benchmark our
actions.
We want everyone respected as a person, having them trusted, treated in a fair manner.
We want to have equality in value while understanding the differences - we think that using different mindsets together delivers way better quality.
We want information to be shared and colleagues to be supported, all for the purpose of continuous improvement.

## Mission

*Raise awareness of gender equality & diversity issues in STEM (science, technology, engineering & math)
through the power of example. We create an open environment where challenges can be understood and means to
overcome them will be provided.*

Our actions will follow this mission. This is what our events shall provide for.
And this is how we will judge our activities to see if they were successful or not.

It's not only about numbers of attendees, although a wider reach is a benefit.
It's about sending the right message to the right people, about strengthening allies
and to develop strategies for improvements.

We think that change has to come in the minds of everyone, irrespective of gender.
Our events shall continue to be open to attendees of any gender and agender persons.
