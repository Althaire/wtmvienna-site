## Values

*Respect, Trust, Fairness, Embrace Differences, Sharing & Supporting, Improvement*

Our values is what we think everyone should be based on. They are also what we use to benchmark our
actions.
We want everyone respected as a person, having them trusted, treated in a fair manner.
We want to have equality in value while understanding the differences - we think that using different mindsets together delivers way better quality.
We want information to be shared and colleagues to be supported, all for the purpose of continuous improvement.
