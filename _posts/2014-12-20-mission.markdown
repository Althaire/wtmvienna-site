## Mission

*Raise awareness of gender equality & diversity issues in STEM (science, technology, engineering & math)
through the power of example. We create an open environment where challenges can be understood and means to
overcome them will be provided.*

Our actions will follow this mission. This is what our events shall provide for.
And this is how we will judge our activities to see if they were successful or not.

It's not only about numbers of attendees, although a wider reach is a benefit.
It's about sending the right message to the right people, about strengthening allies
and to develop strategies for improvements.

We think that change has to come in the minds of everyone, irrespective of gender.
Our events shall continue to be open to attendees of any gender and agender persons.
