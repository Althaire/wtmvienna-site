Welcome to the new website of Women Techmakers Vienna!

Our previous website was focused on functionality and ease of use. These are very important values and
we think they should be at the center of any web site.

With the relaunch we want to add an appealing design and look to the site.
Expect more to come: the event layout will be functional, we will open the call for speakers soon,
a dedicated area for sponsorship will be available and more!

We are very proud of our new website and hope you like it as much as we.
