## Vision

*"Equality & diversity in STEM regardless of gender."*

This is the world we are dreaming of. A world where women don't have to give 120% to be taken full.
A world where men and women are working together in exploring science, developing technology,
construct engineering and building a mathematical foundation.
A world where the choice of a specific major in studying is not a question of gender.

We might often talk about *men* and *women*, but we are aware of the wider range which exists,
the specific views of cis- and transgender people, the aspects of non-binary and of agender persons.
A career or education choice in STEM has to be independent of gender identity.
